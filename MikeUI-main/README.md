Goal is a JS UI framework thats easy to use as well as efficient. First. Make a layout. Second. Change component creation to be intuitive Third. Store refs near top of application. Fourth. Set up listener nodes X far down the tree. Five. Listen on broadcast channel for events. Six. Pass events to child listeners based on queue id (unique)

Thinking I can keep a map of IDs from ariaID or I can just use a weakmap or symbol to hold
